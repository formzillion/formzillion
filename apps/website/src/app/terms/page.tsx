            required to pay these fees, along with any outstanding amounts, as
            specified in the specific terms and conditions for the chosen
            service or package.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3">
            All paid plans must provide a valid credit card. Free accounts are
            not required to submit credit card details. If you upgrade from the
            free plan to a paid plan, you will be billed immediately. The
            Service is billed monthly in advance and is non-refundable. No
            refunds or credits will be given for partial months of service,
            refunds for plan upgrades or downgrades, or unused months with an
            active account. To ensure fairness to all users, no exceptions will

            will be automatically charged the new rate in your next billing
            cycle. Downgrading your Service may result in the loss of content,
            features, or capacity in your account. Formzillion does not accept
            any liability for such loss.

            charges and fees accrued until the termination date will remain even
