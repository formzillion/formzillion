# HTML Native Form

If you have a static website that requires a form backend, Formzillion can be an ideal choice for you as it seamlessly operates wherever HTML forms can be displayed.

## Basic HTML Form

To start using Formzillion for your web forms, you'll require the following:

- A Formzillion account
- An HTML form
- A distinctive form endpoint generated by Formzillion.

### Note

1. Set your HTML form's action attribute to your form's action URL.Your form's unique action URL looks something like this:

```html copy
https://app.formzillion.com/f/your-form-id.
```

2. Ensure all input, select and textarea elements inside your form have a name attribute, otherwise you will not receive the data filled in these fields.

3. Verify that your form contains a button element with the `type = "submit"`

### Example

```html copy {10}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
