# Honeypot

To safeguard your website from spammers and malicious bots, you can employ honeypots. One effective way of achieving this is by incorporating a honeypot into your HTML form. Doing so will help to verify that only genuine users can submit the form

To enable this feature, add a field with the name `_honeypot` to your form and hide it with CSS (see example below). The submission will be silently ignored when a spam bot enters a value.

```html copy
  <input type="hidden" name="_honeypot" style="display:none" />
```

Example

```html copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>FormZillion -Honeypot Spam Provider</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h4>Form with honeypot</h4>
    <form id="form" action="https://app.formzillion.com/f/your-form-id" method="POST">
       <label for="email">Email Address</label>
      <input id="email" type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" name="email" />
