We wholeheartedly appreciate all contributions to Formzillion, as each one plays a vital role in its growth and development. Thank you for your valuable support and dedication to making Formzillion an exceptional open-source form infrastructure. Together, we are shaping a thriving community focused on empowering users with seamless form management solutions.

## Community

As Formzillion is in its initial stages, we are dedicated to building a vibrant and inclusive community. To foster its growth, we kindly ask all community members to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/formzillion/formzillion.com/blob/development/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If any help or feedback is needed, please join our [Slack Community](https://formzillion.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-1urntbbmb-o0d6Qzdl~GzfePoZE7JTYw) and let us know.

## Bugs and issues

Bug reports play a crucial role in enhancing the Formzillion experience for all users. When you report a bug or create a issue, a template will be automatically generated, including essential information that we would greatly appreciate knowing.

Before submitting a new issue, we kindly request that you search for existing ones to ensure you're not creating a duplicate. This helps us streamline the issue tracking process and avoids unnecessary duplication.

## Choosing what to Focus on

To get started, you have the option to explore our existing list of issues or contribute by adding your own improvements to enhance the platform experience. Once you have selected an issue, leave a comment indicating your interest and wait for approval. This process ensures efficient coordination and prevents multiple individuals from working on the same issue simultaneously.

If you have any doubts about whether a proposed feature aligns with the overall vision of Formzillion, we encourage you to raise an issue to discuss it. We are committed to providing timely responses and will promptly address any concerns or questions you may have.

## Crafting and Contributing Code

Formzillion warmly welcomes code contributions from anyone interested. To begin, please refer to the local development guide, where you can find detailed instructions on making your desired changes. Once you have completed your modifications, submit a pull request to the main repository, and our team will review it with enthusiasm. We appreciate your valuable contributions to the growth of Formzillion.
