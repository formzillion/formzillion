# Automate Slack Notifications for Form Submissions

Slack is a messaging app for business that connects people to the information they need. By using slack, you can receive email notifications whenever a user submits a form on your website. This can be a useful way to stay informed about new submissions and respond to them quickly.

9.  After Selecting all the options click on “**Add**” and test the slack workflow action by submitting a test form on your website and verifying that the new submission notification is received on the configured slack workspace.

## Toggling the Slack Workflow

Once you have added the slack action to the form’s workflow, you can toggle the workflow action by:

1.  Navigate to the the “**Workflow**” tab under the selected form
2.  Just click on the toggle switch on the slack action to pause or resume the workflow.

## Troubleshooting Slack Workflow.

If you encounter any issues with slack workflow, such as not receiving notifications on your slack workspace, you can troubleshoot the issue by:

- Verify the connected slack workspace while authorising the connection.
- Reconnecting the slack connection by clicking the the reconnect button under the “**Apps**” tab and reconfigure the options according to your preference.
- Test the workflow by submitting the test submission on the form.
