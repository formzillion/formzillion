# API Access

The API Access feature in Formzillion allows you to programmatically access and manage your form submissions and settings using a REST API. By using the API, you can integrate your form data with other applications and services, automate workflows, and perform custom data analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with the API Access feature, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Formzillion account.
2. Click on the "API Access" tab in the navigation bar.
3. Generate an API key by clicking on the "Generate API Key" button.
4. Copy the API key and use it to authenticate your API requests.

## API Endpoints

The Formzillion API provides endpoints for managing forms, submissions, and settings. Here are some examples of API endpoints that you can use:

- `/api/v1/forms`: Returns a list of forms.
- `/api/v1/forms/{form_id}`: Returns details about a specific form.
- `/api/v1/submissions`: Returns a list of submissions for all forms.
- `/api/v1/submissions/{submission_id}`: Returns details about a specific submission.
- `/api/v1/settings`: Returns global settings for your Formzillion account.

For a full list of API endpoints, refer to the Formzillion API documentation.

## Authentication

To authenticate your API requests, you must include your API key in the request headers. Here's an example of how to include your API key:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key.

## Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse of the Formzillion API, we limit the number of API requests that you can make in a given time period. By default, you can make up to 1000 requests per hour. If you need a higher rate limit, please contact Formzillion support.

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with the API Access feature, here are some troubleshooting guidelines:

1. Check your API key to make sure that it's valid and has the necessary permissions.
2. Verify that you're using the correct API endpoint and HTTP method for your request.
3. Check the response from the API for error messages and codes.
4. If you're still having issues, contact Formzillion support for assistance.
