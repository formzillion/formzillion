## Troubleshooting Spam Filtering

If you're experiencing issues with spam filtering, here are some troubleshooting guidelines:

1. Make sure you are adding your public key in your form. [Learn More](/setup/spam-protection)
2. Check your spam filtering settings to make sure that spam filtering is enabled.
3. Verify that you have configured your spam filtering options correctly, including setting thresholds for filtering.
4. Check your form submissions to make sure that legitimate submissions are not being incorrectly flagged as spam.
5. If you are receiving spam submissions despite having spam filtering enabled, try adjusting your filtering settings or using a third-party spam filtering service.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your forms are protected from spam submissions, while still allowing legitimate submissions to come through.
