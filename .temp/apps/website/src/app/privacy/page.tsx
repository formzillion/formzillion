            Formzillion is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works
            closely with them for a variety of purposes, including assisting us
            to perform and improve the Services. These businesses may sell items
            or services to you through the Services or, with your consent, offer
            promotions (including email promotions) to you. Formzillion may also
            provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated
            businesses, including providing information to such partners to
            allow them to more effectively market to you. When an affiliated
            business assists in facilitating your transaction, we may need to
            share information related to the transaction with that affiliated
            business in order to facilitate your transaction, and this forms
            part of the Services we provide in accordance with our Terms of Use.
            We rely on consent (which can be withdrawn at any time) to send
            marketing messages and for third-party sharing relating to
            advertising.

            Formzillion also needs to engage third-party companies and
            individuals (such as payment processors, research companies, and
            analytics and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and
            market the Services. These third parties have only limited access to
            your information, may use your information only to perform these
            tasks on our behalf, and are obligated to Formzillion not to
            disclose or use your information for other purposes. Our engagement
            of service providers is often necessary for us to provide the
            Services to you, particularly where such companies play important
            roles like processing payments and shipments and helping us keep our
            Service operating and secure. In some other cases, these service
            providers aren’t strictly necessary for us to provide the Services,
            but help us make it better, like by helping us conduct research into
            how we could better serve our users. In these latter cases, we have
            a legitimate interest in working with service providers to make our
            Services better.

            In some cases, Formzillion may choose to buy or sell assets. Such
            transactions may be necessary and in our legitimate interests,
            particularly our interest in making decisions that enable our
            business to develop over the long term. In these types of
            transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or
            transfer of all or substantially all of Formzillion’s assets),
            member information is typically one of the business assets that is
            transferred.

            Third-party plug-ins also may collect information about your use of

            a social plug-in from a third-party site or service, such as a
            “Like” or “Send” button, you are also loading content from that

            sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern
            your use of those sites or services. Formzillion chooses and manages
            these third-party technologies placed on its Sites and Apps.
            However, these are third-party technologies, and they are subject to

            these sellers and API users are independent controllers of data,
