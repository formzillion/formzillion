# Setup

To setup Formzillion, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Formzillion website and sign up for an account.
2. Once you have created an account, you can access the Formzillion dashboard.
3. In the dashboard, click on the "Create Form" button to create a new form.
4. Configure the form settings, including the form fields and any integrations that you need.
5. Click on the "Publish" button to generate the form submit URL.
6. Use the generated form submit URL as the action endpoint in your form HTML code.
7. Test your form to make sure that submissions are being saved and processed correctly.

## AJAX

Easily retrieve submission data from your Formzillion form endpoint through AJAX requests and have complete control over the front-end experience.

### Using Fetch

If you don't want to redirect your form submitters after a submission, FetchAPI is another option we support. Fetch API is similar to XMLHttpRequest but this new API provides powerful features.

## Requirements

Formzillion is a cloud-based service, so there are no specific software or hardware requirements for installation. However, you will need a web browser to access the Formzillion dashboard.

## Integrations

Formzillion provides several integrations with other applications and services, including Slack and Google Sheets. To integrate Formzillion with another service, follow the instructions in the Formzillion dashboard for that integration.

## Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with the installation or configuration of Formzillion, here are some troubleshooting guidelines:

1. Check your form settings to make sure that they are configured correctly.
2. Verify that your form HTML code is correctly referencing the generated form submit URL.
3. Check the Formzillion dashboard for any error messages or notifications.
4. If you're still having issues, contact Formzillion support for assistance.
